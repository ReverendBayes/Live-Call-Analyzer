    // Telecom-specific structured summarization + escalation detection + PII tagging
    // Prompt explanation:
    // This prompt is designed to extract key business and behavioral signals from telecom support calls.
    // It goes beyond summary by:
    // - Identifying emotional shifts (e.g., frustration escalation)
    // - Tagging sensitive data (PII)
    // - Flagging loyalty risk and follow-up gaps
    // - Classifying intent by issue category (Billing, Connectivity, etc.)
    "telecom_prompt": "Analyze the following telecom customer service call and extract:\n\n1. Core issue reported by the customer (e.g., billing error, connectivity failure, equipment complaint).\n2. Classification of the issue: Billing, Connectivity, Retention, General Inquiry, Cancel.\n3. Specific resolution steps taken by the agent (e.g., diagnostics, refunds, technician scheduling).\n4. Degree of customer satisfaction at the end (choose: Satisfied, Dissatisfied, Angry, Frustrated, Neutral).\n5. Was follow-up offered or promised? (Yes/No, with details).\n6. List any personally identifiable information (PII) mentioned (e.g., phone number, email, account ID).\n7. Emotional tone progression of the customer throughout the call (e.g., Calm → Angry, Angry → Calmed, Neutral, Slow escalation, Negative but passive).\n8. Based on the emotional arc, return a recommended resolution tactic. Choose from:\n   - 🔥 Early empathy and proactive follow-up (for Calm → Angry)\n   - 👍 Quick fixes and firm responses (for Angry → Calmed)\n   - 🔍 Monitor for emotional volatility (for Neutral)\n   - 💣 Intervene before escalation completes (for Slow escalation)\n   - 💰 Offer tangible benefit or apology credit (for Negative but passive)\n\nNote:\n- Emotional tone should be based on clear cues in customer language.\n- Tactic must reflect behavioral patterns, not just issue type.\n- Use behavioral reasoning. If sentiment progression doesn't fit known patterns, describe the tone and suggest best-fit tactic based on customer affect and urgency.",

    //What this does:
    // Captures behavioral shifts during the call, like rising frustration or successful de-escalation.
    // Useful for live QA or supervisor review.
    // Common patterns include:
    // 📌 Emotional Tone Progression      📌 Recommended Resolution Tactic                      Outcome
    // - Calm → Angry                    → 🔥  Early empathy and proactive follow-up            Satisfaction ↑, Churn ↓
    // - Angry → Calmed                  → 👍  Quick fixes, firm responses                      Loyalty potential ↑
    // - Neutral                         → 🔍  Monitor for signs of emotional change             -
    // - Slow escalation      → 💣  Intervene before detonation                      High churn risk
    // - Negative but passive            → 💰  Offer tangible benefit or apology credit         Churn risk unless recognized
