    "telecom_prompt": "Analyze the following telecom customer service call and extract:\n\n1. Core issue reported by the customer (e.g., billing error, connectivity failure, equipment complaint).\n2. Classification of the issue: Billing, Connectivity, Retention, General Inquiry, Cancel.\n3. Specific resolution steps taken by the agent (e.g., diagnostics, refunds, technician scheduling).\n4. Degree of customer satisfaction at the end (choose: Satisfied, Dissatisfied, Angry, Frustrated, Neutral).\n5. Was follow-up offered or promised? (Yes/No, with details).\n6. List any personally identifiable information (PII) mentioned (e.g., phone number, email, account ID).\n7. Emotional tone progression of the customer throughout the call (e.g., Calm to Angry, Angry to Calmed, Neutral, Slow escalation, Negative but passive).\n8. Based on the emotional arc, return a recommended resolution tactic. Choose from:\n   - Early empathy and proactive follow-up (for Calm to Angry)\n   - Quick fixes and firm responses (for Angry to Calmed)\n   - Monitor for emotional volatility (for Neutral)\n   - Intervene before escalation completes (for Slow escalation)\n   - Offer tangible benefit or apology credit (for Negative but passive)\n\nNote:\n- Emotional tone should be based on clear cues in customer language.\n- Tactic must reflect behavioral patterns, not just issue type.\n- Use behavioral reasoning. If sentiment progression doesn't fit known patterns, describe the tone and suggest best-fit tactic based on customer affect and urgency."
